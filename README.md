# DO NOT MERGE EVAR!

### This is just a very VERY simple version of cryptoGlance that has been tuned to run on a 320 x 240 pixel display. All it does is grab the BTC latest trade from Quadriga CX's public API, and the latest RDD trade from Cryptsy's public API.

**Note that you require a file in the root named "my-btc-addresses.txt" which contains a comma-separated list of all the addresses you wish to parse for the balance checker screen. This is called from json-blockr.php.**

moar to come, maybe!!
